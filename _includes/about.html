      <p>Everything hurts and I’m dying.</p>
      <p>Hey Leslie. It’s Leslie. Hang in there. I love you. Bye.</p>
      <p>What I hear when I’m being yelled at is people caring really loudly at me.</p>
      <p>I don’t want to be overdramatic, but today felt like a hundred years in hell and the absolute worst day of my
        life.</p>
      <p>We have to remember what's important in life: friends, waffles, and work. Or waffles, friends, and work. But
        work has to come third.</p>
      <p>I ate a brownie once at a party in college. It was kind of indescribable really. It felt like I was floating.
        It turns out that there wasn't any marijuana in it, it was just an insanely good brownie.</p>
