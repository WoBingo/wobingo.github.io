# Wo Chan

> my mommy let me have a website

## About
[wo.bingo](wo.bingo) was designed and coded by [Kyle Decker](https://kyledecker.me). It was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it's freely hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) served with the help of [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) is the domain registrar. 

It couldn't have been made without these applications,
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
- [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/)

these plugins or helpful snippets,
- [Lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes)
- [jQuery Marquee](https://github.com/aamirafridi/jQuery.Marquee)
- [range.css](http://danielstern.ca/range.css/#/)

and two friends that were willing to say yes to almost every dumb idea they came up with.

## Images
The website features photography by [Haley Varacallo](http://www.haleyvaracallo.com) and [Armon Burton](https://www.instagram.com/armbur).

## Typography
Typefaces used are [Acme Regular](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Acme) by [Huerta Tipogr√°fica](https://huertatipografica.com/en) and [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono) by [Colophon Foundry](https://www.colophon-foundry.org/).
